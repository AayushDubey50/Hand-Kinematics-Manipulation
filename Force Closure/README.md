# Force Closure Constraint
Grasping an object requires two constraints: resist external forces, and dextrously manipulate the object. This section will cover the former, i.e. achieving a force-closure grasp.

## Grasp Maps


## Wrench Basis

## Reaching a Force-Closure Grasp


### Convex Optimization
One way of calculating the forces required can be done using convex-optimization.
